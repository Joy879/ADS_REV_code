There are many regression models to work with. Learn more about them [here](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms):
* [Simple Linear Regression](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms/lesson/linear-regression-with-scikit-learn)
* [Decision Trees](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms/lesson/decision-trees-and-hyperparameters)
* [Random Forest](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms/lesson/random-forests-and-regularization)
* [Gradient Boosted Trees](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms/lesson/gradient-boosting-with-xgboost)

Today's class required data from Kaggle which was too large to share. Please downlaod it from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data?select=TrainAndValid.csv).
During the info session on models I talked about Random Forest and you can find the blog [here](https://www.keboola.com/blog/random-forest-regression)
If you need basic information about how to tune it,refer to [this link](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/06/tuning-random-forest-model/)

While we are talking about models, it's also good to mention that you don't need to get deep into the math of how they work but rather know more about how to evaluate them. I admit it does take a while to get acquainted with the technical jargon. One way you can get deep dives is to go through courses, short videos on youtube or surf through infographs on dedicated LinkedIn, Instagram or Twitter accounts. Social media is full of valuable information at your disposal. Also make it a habit to walk through people's code and see how they implemented solutions. For Example for the solution we did in class there are other notebooks available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/code) full of more ways to work on the same competition. Try perusing through 5 of them and run some sample code on your own.. Lastly I highly recommend the Analytics Vidhya free courses found [here](https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/pages/all-free-courses)
