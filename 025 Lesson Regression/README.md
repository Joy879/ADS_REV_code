There are many regression models to work with. Learn more about them [here](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms):
* [Simple Linear Regression](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms/lesson/linear-regression-with-scikit-learn)
* [Decision Trees](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms/lesson/decision-trees-and-hyperparameters)
* [Random Forest](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms/lesson/random-forests-and-regularization)
* [Gradient Boosted Trees](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms/lesson/gradient-boosting-with-xgboost)

Today's class required data from Kaggle which was too large to share. Please downlaod it from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data?select=TrainAndValid.csv).
During the info session on models I talked about Random Forest and you can find the blog [here](https://www.keboola.com/blog/random-forest-regression)
If you need basic information about how to tune it,refer to [this link](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/06/tuning-random-forest-model/)
