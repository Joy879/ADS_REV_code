Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.
It has been _majorly_ :sweat_smile: (not a very statistical term to use)  said that the kind of segmentation strategy to use depends on the type of target market. There are two groups:
* [Business to Business (B2B)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btob.asp)
* [Business to Consumer (B2C)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btoc.asp)


In B2B, a company might segment customers according to a wide range of factors, including:

* Industry
* Number of employees
* Products previously purchased from the company
* Location

In B2C marketing, companies often segment customers according to _demographics_ that include:

* Age
* Gender
* Marital status
* Location (urban, suburban, rural)
* Life stage (single, married, divorced, empty-nester, retired, etc.)

#### Why Segment Customers?
Segmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets. Those efforts can relate to both communications and product development. Specifically, segmentation helps a company:

* Create and communicate targeted marketing messages that will resonate with specific groups of customers, but not with others (who will receive messages tailored to their needs and interests, instead).
* Select the best communication channel for the segment, which might be email, social media posts, radio advertising, or another approach, depending on the segment. 
* Identify ways to improve products or new product or service opportunities.
* Establish better customer relationships.
* Test pricing options.
* Focus on the most profitable customers.
* Improve customer service.
* Upsell and cross-sell other products and services.
