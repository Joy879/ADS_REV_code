## Customer Segmentation

Read the notes [here](https://github.com/Joy879/ADS_REV_code/blob/main/028%20Lessson%20Customer%20Segment/notes.md)
In the notebook shared above  the goals were as follows:
* Use [pandas profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/pandas-profiling/blob/master/README.md) for EDA
* Isolate customers by region
* Clean data
* Divide customers into various groups using [RFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFM_(market_research))
* Try manually segmentation using RFM scores
* Use clustering to also segment the data

## QUESTIONS
##### 1. Using visualizations explore the difference between clusters from _kmeans_ and _loyalty levels_ we had manually assigned
##### 2. Owing to the inconsistent levels in the platinum group, what other considerations can be put in place to cater for people who buy high value goods infrequently

##### 3. Apart from RFM what other segmentation techniques can be applied to this dataset
##### 4. Explore common behaviours/patterns between the customer groups. e.g. What products do they buy, is their purchase seasonal, monthly revenue per customer group and more. You can also attempt to redo [this analysis](https://github.com/Heytec/ADS_REV_code/blob/main/011%20lesson%20Retail%20%20analytics/Retail_Customer_Analysis.ipynb) from the customer groups perspective
